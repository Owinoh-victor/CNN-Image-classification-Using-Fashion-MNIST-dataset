# CNN-Image-classification-Using-Fashion-MNIST-dataset
There's been much speculation in recent years about neural networks technologies and other deep learning algorithms, primarily because of the popularity of several implementations in the sector utilizing these techniques. Consequently, this hype has yielded several innovative ideas to build open-source libraries and methods to enable the average income tech-savvies to achieve their objective. This research paper aims to examine and illustrate how to use deep learning technologies and algorithms to precisely classify a dataset of fashion images into their respective clothing categories. First, the paper shows the general knowledge of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and the techniques of image classification. Later on, it also discusses the methodology of building a neural network and the simulation process. The results of the neural network simulation are compressively evaluated and discussed.
